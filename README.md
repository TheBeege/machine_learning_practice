# PyTorch Learning

I'm not specifically setting this up as a learning resource for other people, but I figure if it works for maybe, maybe someone else will find it useful, too.

I have a strong programming background, first-level calculus knowledge (derivatives, summations), and a lot of general, qualitative reading about how machine learning works. I tried jumping right into PyTorch, but I didn't understand a lot of the vocabulary. I found [Robert Grosse's machine learning course page](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc321_2018) and am using that to try to learn things.

Feedback and corrections are always appreciated.
